Leavenworth Cards
===================
## Technologies used
* Vue
* Vuex
* Jest
* Less

I created this project with Vue to showcase photos I took on a trip to Leavenworth, providing me an opportunity to expand on my Vue skills.  But wanting to build something more than a photo gallery, I built a table of cards with German-English translations, given the fact that I was in a Bavarian themed town.  Based off a Treehouse course on Vue Basics I had watched, I found myself feeling more creative with my coding skills, building upon the course with additional features.  After showing my family my project, I was surprised with the amount of positive feedback I got on the flash cards component, so I opted to recreate my project as a stand-alone app.
